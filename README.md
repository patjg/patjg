- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @patjg 
- Iâ€™m interested in general software engineering and data science. I'm new to this field and have a bit of weird backstory. I am currently working as an academic advisor at a Department of Computer Science at a relatively large university, and while I do this I am slowly working towards a Master's in CS. I am learning C++ (primarily) and Python, and have done a bit of learning about SQL. 
- I am open to any feedback you may have on my programming projects as I am always looking to get better.
